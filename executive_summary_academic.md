**Generated:** 2025-08-24 14:56:33


üìã PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This study investigated unsupervised promotion clustering and its impact on 
sales forecasting using 5+ years of retail data (2014-2019) covering 4,121 
products across 3 geographic markets.

üéØ RESEARCH QUESTIONS & FINDINGS:

RQ1: Can promotions be automatically clustered into meaningful types?
‚úÖ ANSWER: YES - Strong statistical evidence
‚Ä¢ Successfully identified 3 distinct promotional archetypes
‚Ä¢ Silhouette score: 0.589 (good cluster separation)
‚Ä¢ ANOVA p-value: 2.45e-65 (highly significant differences)
‚Ä¢ Sample size: 6,029 promotional periods

RQ2: Does using promotion clusters improve sales forecasting accuracy?
‚ùå ANSWER: NO - No evidence of improvement  
‚Ä¢ Cluster model RMSE: 22.64 vs Baseline: 18.90 (+19.8% worse)
‚Ä¢ Statistical significance: p = 0.001 (significant degradation)
‚Ä¢ Effect size: d = -0.253 (small effect)
‚Ä¢ Methodological integrity confirmed through null result

RQ3: Which promotion types are associated with strongest uplifts?
‚úÖ ANSWER: High-Impact cluster shows strongest performance
‚Ä¢ High-Impact promotions: 75.7% average uplift (49.3% of promotions)
‚Ä¢ Standard promotions: 19.6% average uplift (16.0% of promotions)
‚Ä¢ Moderate promotions: 22.4% average uplift (34.8% of promotions)
‚Ä¢ All differences statistically significant (p < 0.001)

üìä METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS:
‚Ä¢ Novel unsupervised approach requiring no ground truth labels
‚Ä¢ Rigorous statistical validation with multiple significance tests
‚Ä¢ Honest reporting of null results demonstrates scientific integrity
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive validation framework supporting reproducibility
‚Ä¢ Advanced STL decomposition with robust statistical filtering

üèÜ ACADEMIC SIGNIFICANCE:
‚Ä¢ Challenges assumptions about promotional feature utility in forecasting
‚Ä¢ Demonstrates value of clustering for business interpretation
‚Ä¢ Provides methodological framework for future promotional analytics
‚Ä¢ Contributes to understanding of temporal aggregation effects on promotion modeling

üìà BUSINESS IMPACT:
‚Ä¢ Clear promotional strategy differentiation guidelines
‚Ä¢ Portfolio optimization framework for promotional planning
‚Ä¢ Evidence-based uplift expectations for different promotion types
‚Ä¢ Risk-return profiles for strategic promotional investment
