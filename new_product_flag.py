New Product Introduction Flagging and Filtering Script

This script identifies and filters out newly introduced products in the sales dataset.
It detects product-country pairs that don't have a full sales history from the beginning
of the dataset and creates a clean dataset containing only products with complete history.

Key Features:
- Identifies first sales week for each product-country pair
- Flags products introduced after the dataset start date
- Creates clean dataset with only full-history products
- Provides statistics on new product introduction rates

This filtering is important for downstream analysis as:
1. New product launches often show atypical sales patterns
2. Incomplete history complicates time series modeling
3. Promotional detection algorithms may falsely flag product launches as promotions

Input:
- sales_data_train.csv: Training dataset from split_weekly_sales_train_eval.py

Output:
- sales_data_full_history_only.csv: Filtered dataset with only full-history products

Usage:
    python new_product_flag.py
